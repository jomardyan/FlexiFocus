This Privacy Policy describes how the browser extension **FlexiFocus** (the "Extension") provided by **jomardyan** ("we", "us", or "our") handles information when used in supported browsers, including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

By installing or using the Extension, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Scope

This Privacy Policy applies solely to the Extension as distributed through:
- The Chrome Web Store for Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers.
- The Microsoft Edge Add-ons store for Microsoft Edge.

It does not apply to any websites, services, or applications that may be linked from the Extension but are operated by third parties under their own privacy policies.

## 2. Data Collection and Processing

**FlexiFocus does not collect, store, transmit, or process any personal data or personally identifiable information (PII).**

- Use cookies or similar tracking technologies
- Track your behavior across websites
- Perform any profiling, analytics, or user tracking
- Send any data to external servers

All features of the Extension work entirely offline and locally within your browser, in line with data minimization principles for Chrome and Edge extensions.

## 3. Local Processing and Storage

- All processing performed by the Extension occurs **locally within your browser**.
- Timer settings, preferences, task lists, and session history are stored **only in your browser's local storage** (chrome.storage.local).
- This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.

- **Data**: Stored only in your browser's local storage

Because the Extension does not collect, store, or process any personal information, it does not knowingly collect information from children of any age. The Extension is safe for users of all ages as no data collection occurs.

- Changes in the Extension's functionality or behavior
- Updates to applicable laws, regulations, or browser extension policies

When changes are made:
